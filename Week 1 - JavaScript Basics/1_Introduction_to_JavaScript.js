console.log("\n   Name: Brendan Eich");
console.log("   About: JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was initially called Mocha, then LiveScript, and finally became known as JavaScript. It was standardized as ECMAScript in 1997.");

console.log("\n2. Title: Key Features");
console.log("   Name: Client-Side Scripting");
console.log("   About: JavaScript runs in web browsers, allowing web pages to become interactive without needing to reload. Itâ€™s event-driven, meaning it can respond to user actions like clicks and keyboard input.");

console.log("\n3. Title: Basic Syntax");
console.log("   Name: Variables");
console.log("   About: Variables are used to store data values. For example, let name = 'Shivek'; stores the name 'Shivek.'");

console.log("\n4. Title: Functions");
console.log("   Name: Reusable Code");
console.log("   About: Functions are blocks of code designed to perform specific tasks. For instance, function greet() { console.log('Hello, World!'); } creates a function that prints 'Hello, World!' when called.");

console.log("\n5. Title: Conditional Statements");
console.log("   Name: Control Flow");
console.log("   About: Conditional statements, like if, control the flow of a program based on conditions. For example, it can check if someone is an adult or a minor based on their age.");

console.log("\n6. Title: Loops");
console.log("   Name: Repeat Code");
console.log("   About: Loops execute a block of code multiple times. For example, a for loop can print numbers from 0 to 4.");

console.log("\n7. Title: DOM Manipulation");
console.log("   Name: Interacting with Web Pages");
console.log("   About: JavaScript can change the content and style of web pages through the Document Object Model (DOM). For example, it can update text on a webpage dynamically.");

console.log("\n8. Title: Libraries and Frameworks");
console.log("   Name: jQuery, React, Angular, Vue.js");
console.log("   About: These tools help developers create web applications more efficiently. For instance, React is a library for building user interfaces, while Angular is a framework for developing complex web applications.");

console.log("\n9. Title: Modern JavaScript (ES6 and Beyond)");
console.log("   Name: New Features");
console.log("   About: Modern JavaScript introduced new features like arrow functions and classes, making the code easier to write and understand. For example, const add = (a, b) => a + b; is an arrow function that adds two numbers.");

console.log("\n10. Title: Development Environment");
console.log("   Name: Browsers and Node.js");
console.log("   About: JavaScript can be run in web browsers like Chrome and Firefox, as well as on servers using Node.js, which allows for backend development.");

console.log("\n11. Title: Learning Resources");
console.log("   Name: Online Tutorials and Books");
console.log("   About: Many resources are available for learning JavaScript, including websites like freeCodeCamp and books like 'Eloquent JavaScript,' which can help you grasp the language better.");

console.log("\nConclusion: JavaScript is a vital programming language for creating interactive websites. By learning its basics and exploring advanced topics, you can become proficient in web development.");
